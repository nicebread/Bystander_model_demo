# Demo repository: Formal model for the bystander effect

This repository presents a formalization of the "Bystander Effect" and the "Diffusion of Responsibility" as explanatory theory.

- The theory is formalized as a VAST display (see `Bystander_model.drawio` and `Bystander_model.pdf`).
- The supplementary tables (Construct Source Table, Variable Table, and Relationship Table) are in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/158x8mko3IZsWBp_Gm_eeCmP3cIwDK5iWHc0vQX2CZRA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Subfolder `/simulation` contains the R code for an implemented, generative formal model
